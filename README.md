# CSS Interview

In this project, you'll add some style to the project you created in `html-interview`.

## Instructions

* For this project, you will not be forking this repository.  Instead, you will build on your 'html-interview' project.
* Add a new file called `styles.css` to your html-interview project on your local machine
* Go to your HTML and add a line of code to import your new CSS file
* Finally, edit `styles.css` to style the page in the following ways
  * Add a blue border to each `<div>` element
  * Change the font of each header element to any font that you like
  * Set each image to have a border radius of `50px`
  * Add `25px` of padding to each `<div>` element
  * Add `10px` of margin to each `<li>` element
  * Italicize each `<li>` element
* Add your styles file to your 'html-interview' on github
* If you have connected to CodeGrade for your html-interview assignment, you are done!
